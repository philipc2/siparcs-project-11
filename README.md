# Project 13: Development of High-Performance & Scalable Data Analysis Routines for Unstructured Grids
Mentors: Philip Chmielowiec, Orhan Eroglu

## Project Description 

Project Raijin was awarded by NSF EarthCube in order to develop
community-owned, sustainable, and scalable tools for performing standard data analysis and
visualization routines on unstructured (ie. not regular lat/lon grids) climate and global weather
meshes at global storm resolving resolutions. The development of Project Raijin leverages the
Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE), particularly the open development Xarray and Dask
packages, and the Pangeo community. Our work is conducted under an open development
model that encourages participation of the community in all aspects of the project’s
development. As a result of this, the majority of Raijin’s development is centered around the
UXarray Python Package, which is an Xarray-like package for directly working with and
analyzing unstructured meshes that reside on a sphere (i.e. climate model output)

During this internship, you will work directly with the engineers and scientists behind the
UXarray package to research, develop, and implement high-performance data analysis routines
for unstructured grids on a sphere, such as computational operators, visualization methods, or
efficient data structures. You will also learn high performance computing (HPC) principles
through use of NCAR’s HPC clusters as well as through researching and leveraging
parallelization and optimization libraries such as Dask, Numba, CuPy, and Datashader. Most, if
not all, of the student’s work will be made publicly available through our open development
model, which will in turn help this intern create a strong Python portfolio in data analysis and
software engineering. The Project Raijin team is excited to provide the student with an in-depth
experience of working within a professional software engineering team; therefore, the student
will participate in all project development activities such as regular team meetings, morning
standups, hackathons, cross-team discussion/collaboration meetings, debugging and bug-fixing,
pair programming, documentation, etc.
